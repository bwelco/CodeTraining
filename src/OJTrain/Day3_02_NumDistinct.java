        Given a string S and a string T, count the number of distinct subsequences of T in S.
        A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by
        deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions
        of the remaining characters. (ie,"ACE"is a subsequence of"ABCDE"while"AEC"is not).
        Here is an example:
        S ="rabbbit", T ="rabbit"
        Return3.
